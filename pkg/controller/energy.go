	// We evaluated several options to handle weekend/weekday differences, EV charging spikes, and guests in town:
	//
	// - Option A (Same Weekday Baseline):
	//   Isolates historical days matching the exact target weekday (e.g. all previous Fridays).
	//   * Advantages: Perfect for capturing weekday-specific signatures (e.g. laundry on Fridays, baking on Sundays).
	//   * Drawbacks: Slow to adapt. If a structural shift occurs (e.g., family moves in, raising load from 1.0 KWH to 2.0 KWH),
	//     Option A will average in all old low-usage history, taking several weeks to reflect the new baseline.
	//
	// - Option B (Recent 7 Days average):
	//   Uses the last 7 valid days in history, ignoring day-of-week distinctions.
	//   * Advantages: Adapts instantly (within a few days) to structural load changes.
	//   * Drawbacks: Loses all weekday specificity. A peak that only occurs on Sundays is smeared across all days,
	//     making predictions flat and inaccurate for specific days of the week.
	//
	// - Option C (50/50 Blend of A & B) & Option D (Inverse-Variance Blending):
	//   Combines Option A and Option B linearly (either with static 0.5 weights or weighted by their historical variance).
	//   * Advantages: Represents a mathematical compromise between responsiveness and specificity.
	//   * Drawbacks: Can still dilute day-of-week peaks on normal weeks, and spreads random one-off spikes (like EV charging
	//     on recent days) across all weekday forecasts.
	//
	// - Option E (Z-score Hard Threshold Blend) & Option F (Z-score Smooth Blend):
	//   Computes a z-score of the recent 7-day average relative to the historical weekday baseline. If the z-score indicates
	//   a significant deviation, it blends Option B in to adapt.
	//   * Advantages: Avoids diluting the weekday profile during normal operations.
	//   * Drawbacks: Blending Option B directly still compromises the hourly "shape" of the forecast with the flat 7-day average.
	//     Hard thresholds (Option E) can cause sudden jumps (jitter) in consecutive model runs.
	//
	// - Option G (Adaptive Shifted Option A - Selected):
	//   We use Option A (Same Weekday) as our base shape to preserve sharp, hour-specific peaks. We then calculate a flat
	//   constant shift (offset) to apply to the entire day if recent loads have deviated.
	//   To do this, we compute the daily average difference (actual - expected) over the last 4 valid days.
	//   * Advantages:
	//     1. Retains the high-fidelity hourly profile shape (e.g. Friday laundry peak is kept at the correct hour).
	//     2. Adapts quickly to structural changes by shifting the entire profile up or down.
	//     3. Immune to intermittent EV charging spikes. Because an EV charge occurs only on some days, it increases
	//        the standard deviation (variance) of the differences. In the formula: zScore = meanDiff / stdDevDiff,
	//        a larger standard deviation shrinks the z-score, keeping it below our threshold and preventing a false shift.
	//
	// We calculate the difference between actual daily averages and their respective weekday baseline expectations
	// for the last 4 valid days. If these differences are consistent (low variance), the standard deviation remains small,
	// yielding a high z-score. If they are volatile (high variance due to random EV charging), the standard deviation is large,
