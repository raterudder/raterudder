**Learning:** React frontend components sometimes fallback to plain text loading indicators (e.g., `<div>Loading...</div>`) during asynchronous operations instead of using the consistent, styled visual loading state with the spinner.
**Action:** When working on UX for React components, identify plain text loading screens and replace them with the `<div className="loading-screen"><span className="loading-spinner loading-spinner-large" aria-hidden="true"></span>...</div>` pattern. Always remember to use `aria-hidden="true"` on the spinner to ensure screen readers focus on the semantic text.
## 2024-05-24 - Hide decorative hamburger menu lines from screen readers
**Learning:** Purely visual, CSS-driven decorative elements like the spans used for a hamburger menu icon can clutter screen reader output if not explicitly hidden. Even if the parent button has a descriptive `aria-label`, the empty child spans might still be announced.
**Action:** Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to empty `<span>` tags that are used solely for decorative purposes, such as building icon lines via CSS.
